- Missing Data Not at Random (MNAR): There is a relationship between Data Missing and any other values.
- Missing at random (MAR)

### FEATURE ENGINEERING | TECHNIQUES TO HANDLE MISSING VALUES
- Mean/Median/Mode
- Random Sample Imputation
- Capturing NAN values with a new feature
- End of Distribution Imputation
- Arbitary Imputation
- Frequent Categories Imputation
