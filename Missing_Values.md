# ðŸ›  FEATURE ENGINEERING | MISSING VALUES

### FEATURE ENGINEERING | TYPES OF MISSING VALUES
- Missing Completely at Random (MCAR): Probability of being missing is same for all observations. There is no relationship between Data Missing and any other values (Random Subset of Data).
- Missing Data Not at Random (MNAR): There is a relationship between Data Missing and any other values.
- Missing at random (MAR)

### FEATURE ENGINEERING | TECHNIQUES TO HANDLE MISSING VALUES
- Mean/Median/Mode -> Missing Completely at Random
- Random Sample Imputation -> Missing Completely at Random
- Capturing NAN values with a new feature -> Missing Data Not at Random 
- End of Distribution Imputation
- Arbitary Imputation
- Frequent Categories Imputation
